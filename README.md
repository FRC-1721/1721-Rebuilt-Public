# 1721-Rebuilt-Public
This project contains FRC 1721 Tidal Force's public code for 2026's FRC season: REBUILT. You can follow physical robot development on our OpenAlliance build thread on [ChiefDelphi](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/tidal-force-1721-open-alliance-build-blog-2026/509680). You can also find previous year's robot code on our profile. This repository will be updated as needed with stable and useable code for our robot. Please email [concordroboticsteam1721@gmail.com](mailto:concordroboticsteam1721@gmail.com) or reply to our OpenAlliance thread to ask us any questions you may have.
